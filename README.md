# Child-Selector
Welcome to the **Child-Selector Project**! ðŸŽ¯ This project is designed to help you master CSS selectors by practicing how to style HTML elements **without using classes or IDs**.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Files
- **selectors.html**: The HTML file containing various elements
- **selectors.css**: The CSS file where you will write your selectors to style the elements.

## ðŸš€ Project Goals
- Practice using **CSS selectors** effectively without relying on class or ID attributes.
- Understand how to target specific elements using:
  - Element selectors
  - Pseudo-classes (e.g., `:nth-child`, `:first-child`, `:last-child`)
  - Pseudo-elements (e.g., `::before`, `::after`)
